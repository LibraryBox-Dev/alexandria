Alexandria: A librarian for your stuff
======================================

Alexandria is one part file management, one part system management. It serves as
a replacement for the diasporatic interfaces and configuration frameworks that
make up the configuration and usage of systems such as LibraryBox, PirateBox and
others.

Alexandria is built with Python, and intended for low-power devices such as the Raspberry Pi. It needs about 30MB of RAM to work, on top of any other things you put on it.
