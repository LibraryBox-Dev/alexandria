        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Alexandria is a replacement for the many, many scripts that made up the original PirateBox software. PirateBox was then adapted to handle other systems such as LibraryBox (a more "read only" environment) as well as BiblioBox.

        <p> So what does Alexandria try to accomplish? Simple, really: It tries to ecompass all the tasks neccesary for a small, hyperlocal file sharing platform.Alexandria replaces the need for OpenWRT's framework, making the configuration itself agnostic to the underlying Linux distribution underneath.<p>
        <p> Alexandria is built on time-tested tech: Python, the Flask framework, and Debian make up the core Alexandria distribution. This means stability in the face of adversity.</p>

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>When you first start an Alexandria-enabled device, you'll see a wireless network appear local to you. This network will have a name such as "LibraryBox", "PirateBox" or another similar name. Check with your distribution's documentation</p>
        <p>The first thing you need to do is change the password that is used to administrate your device. Doing so makes sure that other users aren't going to <em>accidentially</em> change the settings on your device. To do this, you'll want to</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect to your device's wifi network</li>
            <li>Navigate to your device. By default, this will be <code>alexandria.lan</code> -- however, this may change depending on the distribution. Check with your distribution's documentation.</li>
            <li>Choose "admin" at the front page</li>
            <li>Enter the default password: <code>librarian</code></li>
            <li>Choose "General Configuration" from the list of options</li>
            <li>Enter a new password in the "Administrative Password" box</li>
            <li>Press "save"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will be prompted to reboot your device. If you choose not to, all administration pages will inform you that the settings you have changed will not go into effect until you have rebooted your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row marketing">
        <h1>Wireless Network options</h1>
        <h2>To use a self-contained network</h2>
        <p>This is the default configuration. To change settings related to the network itself (name, security, etc), you'll need to look at <code>hostapd</code> under <code>Service Configuration</code> in administration section. The settings most interesting to people are:
            <dl>
                <dt>802.11 channel</dt>
                <dd>The channel (1-11) that the network will be on; Commonly, home access points use 3, 6 and 11.</dd>
                <dt>WPA2 security</dt>
                <dd>Turning on this enables encryption on your network using WPA2 security. This is supported by most devices and should be fine for most use. Note that turning this on will require users to know the <em>WPA2 Passphrase</em>.</dd>
                <dt>WPA2 Passphrase</dt>
                <dd>The password used for encryption. If WPA2 security is turned on, all users who wish to connect must know this. It must be between 8 and 63 characters and may contain spaces and special characters (<code>!@#$%</code>, etc.) Using characters from languages other than english is possible, but may not work properly.</dd>
           </dl>
           </p>
        <h2>Connecting your device to an established network</h2>
        <p>This scenario involves turning off several services. Notably, you must
        <ol>
            <li>Turn off the <code>DNSMasq</code> service</li>
            <li>Turn off the <code>HostAPd</code> service</li>
            <li>Set the wireless network interface to "client" mode</li>
            <li>Enable DHCP or configure IP information.</li>
        </li>
