#GSoC 2017: Berkman Klein center at Harvard.

Writeup by Morgan Gangwere <morgan.gangwere!gmail.com> github.com/indrora



My original proposal and the final product look... a little bit different. In
the beginning, the goal was to get the basics of what made LibraryBox and
PirateBox working on a Pi, then refine them down.

What ended up happening is a mostly total rewrite of the backend, including a
configuration file generator, a socket server and a handful of other little
things.

#So what have I done for myself?

The first thing I did was dig into the orignal PirateBox tree. This quickly led
me down the path of going "oh dear this isn't going to end well". The original
design of PirateBox and LibraryBox is to use the OpenWRT framework for configuratrion.

I looked at OpenWRT on the Pi 3. And then I saw what the work on OpenWRT for the
pi 3 was... lacking.

So I wrote everything myself in Python. One of the maintainers wanted to build
the world off archlinux arm, but I felt that might be a bit too moving of a
target, so I went for Debian (well, Raspbian) so that I could base things off a
known, solid and stable base.

In the end, I've built Alexandria, the software that I think will run a newer
generation of LibraryBoxes and PirateBoxes and etc. etc. etc.

Fun fact: if you telnet to the default installation on port :3333, you get nyancat.

I had a lot of *fun*. It was interesting to hash out the pros and cons of simply
doing a huge rewrite vs. porting things over. In the end, porting thigs over was
simply not going to work and left me with a lot of loose ends that I didn't want
to really get involved in.



# Still to do

*This is a laundry list; some of them are nits that will take a while to get
hammered out, others will possibly take a few hours of working on it*.

* There's something in iOS that makes iOS think that this is a captive network.
  I need to figure that out, and there's some forum posts that I've encountered
  that make it seem like if there's no domain out there, then the network is
  probably a home network and hopefully safe. I don't have good information on
  any of this.
* Nginx is hard-coded in certain respects. I'd like to make it so that nginx
  configuration is done by the configuration generator script instead of being
  hand-baked. This would let proxy_pass statements be generated for services
  such as Calibre's server backend.
* There isn't any way to rename files or other wise fix files.
* fuse isn't configured at first boot like it should.
* the install scripts are fragile
* It takes 5 minutes to get to a wireless network being around and there. This
  would likely need some basic tuning
* The internal storage doesn't work. Instead, all files are currently written to
  the SD card regardless *unless* your disk is formatted something that can be
  mangled out of the box by Debian, since I didn't get fuse working.
* There's a handful of places that need to be fixed in the documentation. Lots of
  typos and the whole thing could use some pictures.

Finally, one that REALLY bugs me: I haven't tested this aginst the latest build
of Raspbian. The final days of the coding period and guess what: Raspberry Pi foundation
shipped Debian 9 on the Pi. Having this would have fundamentally made my life
better if I had had this from the get-go, but you can't win all the time.
